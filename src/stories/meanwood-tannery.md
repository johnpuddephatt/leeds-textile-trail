Meanwood Tannery is the best preserved large scale tannery in Leeds, which once made Meanwood one of the leading tanning towns in the country.

Tanning is the activity of turning animal hides into leather, in order to make products such as belts, coats, shoes, and horse saddles. Once a common industry there are few tanneries remaining in the UK, most taking place in developing countries where the trade is often hazardous.

The present building was built as a tannery for Samuel Smith. Before that, Thomas Martin ran a paper mill on the site, and from 1230 - 1785 corn milling took place, originally run by monks from Kirkstall Abbey.
