In the 1950s and 1960s the ‘Cyril Livingstone’ shop on Albion street, just off Briggate, was the place to be seen in Leeds. Cyril himself was a theatre director, actor, set designer and couturier, most known for co-founding the Jewish acting group Proscenium Players. People would flock to the shop to purchase his latest bespoke pieces, and he would frequently offer his discerning opinions on what would suit his clients best.

Cyril grew up around textiles and womenswear as his family owned a clothes shop on Commercial Street, which later moved to North Street. Named Messrs. J Livingstone, after his father, the original shop dealt in gowns and mantles for women.Even in the 1920s the shop was incredibly successful with women, often featured in local newspapers as one of the more popular clothing outlets to visit. Cyril took over the shop in the late 1940s, renaming it and continuing the family legacy.
