From Kirkgate Market to 790 UK stores and 86,000 staff, Marks & Spencer is a much loved high-street name. Michael Marks, a Jewish immigrant from Slonim, Belarus opened his first bazaar in 1884. He initially priced things individually but soon realised pricing everything for a penny worked better, with the slogan becoming ‘don’t ask the price, it’s a penny’. By 1894 he found a partner in Tom Spencer, who invested £300 into the business. By the turn of the twentieth century the pair had 36 Penny Bazaars, 12 high street shops with several market stalls too.

Needle and thread, buttons and fastenings were sold in the early periods, along with ready-made sleeves and collars – just like a haberdashery – but as time went on the shops diversified and sold garments too. By World War II there were huge changes to production of goods, including clothing. Restrictions were placed on all materials used to make garments. This meant production methods altered but Marks & Spencer strived to offer quality garments under controlled regulations.

The [M&S Company Archive](https://marksintime.marksandspencer.com/home) was established in Leeds in 2012 and was set up to keep the history of Michael Marks and Tom Spencer alive.   You can watch a recent talk introducing the clothing archive [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVwtTlaKLxY&list=PLcImqkHEpk0rU47yBbwR3NV_jEgmrJ5rX&index=20).  

Today they hope to become the world’s largest sustainable retailer.
