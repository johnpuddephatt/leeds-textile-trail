### Joanne Boulter

**BA (Hons) Fashion Design, University of Leeds (current student)** 

**Motivation.** The initial motivation for the zero-waste work was the recognition that designers need to reflect more on the impact that their decision making can have on the environment. Experimenting with low waste and zero waste design techniques was a way to discover how a designer can actively reduce pre consumer waste and the amount of fabric that gets discarded during the production of clothing.

**Inspiration.** To inspire the work, the concept of organic architecture was explored. The idea that man-made structures can be designed to be harmonious with the natural environment is a concept that zero waste aims to achieve within fashion, by eliminating waste and therefore becoming more sustainable. The seamless appearance between the buildings and landscape, as well as the curved silhouettes of some of the architecture, was expanded on further throughout the design process through the exploration of unconventional seams and topstitching details. The combination of aiming to achieve zero waste outcomes whilst highlighting features of the organic architecture inspiration led to more creative design thinking and encouraged experimentation outside of conventional pattern cutting.

**Making Process.** The side seams of both the toiles were eliminated, this reduced the amount of waste in the lay plans and enabled the curved seams (a design feature) to travel smoothly around the garments. Although there was a small amount of waste during the toiling stage, the different techniques experimented with in both garments can be fused together and improved to achieve a more efficient outcome.

### Dominic Browning

**BA (Hons) Fashion Graduate, Leeds Beckett University**

Dominic Browning is a sustainable textile artist who works with second–hand clothes and forgotten fabrics. Dominic creates his recycled material through utilising wrong sides, right sides, seams and holes of rescued knitwear and other disposed of garments, combining them to create his sustainable artwork. His work is about celebrating the history of all the recycled garments involved and their newly founded future.

Dominic studied Fashion at Leeds Beckett University where he graduated with first–class honours. He dedicated his last year of studies to sustainable textiles where he created a 6 outfit collection made completely from rescued fabrics. Since graduating, Dominic has continued to advocate for sustainability in and around Leeds. He has completed and sold commissions and artwork, and also taken part in talks, presentations and news segments.

He believes his work to be a conversation starter, catalysing people to question their own emotional attachments with certain pieces of clothing but also intrigue people into asking when viewing his work ‘Who originally owned this piece of recycled cloth?” or “Who will own this piece in the future?”, opening up for the topic of landfill, unnecessary disposal and the importance of emotional relationships with clothing to be discussed.

Dominic’s work is available to view at Leeds Beckett University and on his Instagram [@dominicbrowningtextiles](https://www.instagram.com/dominicbrowningtextiles)

### Alena Chalmovska

**MA Creative Practice Graduate, Leeds Arts University**

Alena is a fashion designer with more than twenty years of experience of studying and working in the fashion and textiles industry. As a native of the Slovak Republic, she is interested in fusing traditional techniques from her heritage with modern, ethical, sustainable and gender–neutral children’s wear. She produces entirely hand spun and hand knitted garments that explore traditional stitching techniques used in Slovak Kroj (a traditional costume in Slovak heritage).

Of her work Alena says, “During the ten years I worked in fast fashion I was often sent to India, Turkey and Uzbekistan where I saw first–hand how fast fashion exploits people in developing countries, when I eventually left the industry to raise my family and develop my own collections, I resolved only to use the most ethical sources”.

These days Alena makes garments that are designed to be cherished and passed down, an antidote to the unsustainable fast fashion she witnessed first–hand. These garments use the most ethical and sustainable raw materials possible, even the wool comes from a source in Slovakia who does not farm sheep for meat, but keeps them for grazing land and for wool. This became more and more important to her during her MA at Leeds Arts University as she learned about the mistreatment of animals in the wool trade.

Alena is also collating her own knitting patterns and considering publishing a pattern book that will also emphasise the importance of keeping dying craft skills alive and documented for the future.

### Lorna Jewitt

**MA Creative Practice Graduate, Leeds Arts University**

Lorna has a long held interest in traditional sewn and printed textile techniques, combined with a particular appreciation of the tactility of old and worn cloth. Her work has always been concerned with the idea of the lost, forgotten or anonymous, and the connections that can be researched, or imagined, of the previous use or ownership of ordinary, everyday fabrics and clothing. The Japanese concept of wabi sabi – beauty in imperfection – has particular resonance in her work.

Interested in the processes of archiving and of textile archives in particular, the idea of the seemingly insignificant as ‘ordinary treasure’ has underpinned work inspired by particular aspects of Sunny Bank Mills Archive. This included a body of work that incorporated actual ephemera from the archive’s cleaning and recording processes, particularly from the the many guard books of samples of cloth – the loose threads, rusty paperclips, soot, scraps of paper, etc. – combined with print and stitch.

More recently, work has been inspired by the ongoing regeneration of parts of Sunny Bank Mills and the demolition of some of the mill buildings.

A collection of works were made in response to various ‘found’ pieces of unwanted, or broken materials and equipment that were once part of the everyday working life of the mill. These included loose paint flakes from the walls, rust from old reeds, old wool sacks, and various bits of shuttles, bobbins, etc, all referencing some aspect of the production of worsted cloth.

The intention is to question the perceived value and meaning of those pieces of unusable or unwanted ‘rubbish’, to preserve them for their fragility and ephemeral textural qualities, as part of a long history of a working textile mill.
