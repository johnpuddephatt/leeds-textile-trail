Amongst the bhel puri kits, the pots and pans and the spice stalls, youâ€™ll find some of the most beautiful fabrics, clothing and jewellery in Yorkshire. Each Wednesday since 2010, the Asian Bazaar at Leeds Kirkgate Market has been open for us to browse and explore.

Makers and tailors can take advantage of the beautiful fabrics on offer and make their own colourful makes, whilst the less confident amongst us can browse incredibly detailed ready-made (often handmade) clothes.

Even if its typical Yorkshire weather, a morning here and your senses are transported to the bustling streets of India or Pakistan.
