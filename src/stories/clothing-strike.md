Concerns about employment terms in the fashion industry are not new. In February 1970, textile workers in Leeds began an unofficial strike in support of their demand for a shilling an hour pay increase. The strike snowballed, with workers attracting further support as they marched from clothing factory to clothing factory – until more than 20,000 people were involved, the majority of them women.

The strike originated at the John Collier Ltd. factories in Kirkstall; from there workers marched into Leeds, where they gathered supporters at Headrow Clothes on Westgate and Marlbeck Fashions, near St. George’s Crypt, before proceeding further into the city centre. The strike lasted around 2-weeks and was one of the first victories in the movement towards equal pay.
