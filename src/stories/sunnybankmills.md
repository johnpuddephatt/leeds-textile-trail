Sunny Bank Mills is a living demonstration that the tools of the past can help to build a more sustainable future.

Founded in 1829 by a group of local clothiers, including John Gaunt, ancestor to the current owners, it went on to create fine worsted suit cloth destined for Savile Row and exported around the world. Sunny Bank Mills continued to produce the worldâ€™s finest worsted suit cloth until 2008, when production ceased, after 180 years. Today the site is being sustainably regenerated, recycling and reusing existing materials and investing in energy technology to reduce its impact. It is now home to over 75 creative businesses including a gallery, art studios and an Archive.

The Archive aims to be accessible to all, sharing the objects and the stories of the people that worked here.  With the wool cloth, mill objects and stories, the Archive is helping to inform future generations about the beauty of textiles and is an antidote to the waste of fast fashion. The vast knowledge and experience of this textile heritage is finding a new future in the creative businesses at Sunny Bank Mills, such as School of Sew and Scrap Centre of Creative Reuse.
