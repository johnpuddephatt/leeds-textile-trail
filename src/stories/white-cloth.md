Before the building of the First White Cloth Hall in 1710-11, there was no central location for cloth producers to sell their wares to local merchants in Leeds. Fearing that Wakefield would rise to prominence as a trading centre of the West Riding cloth industry, the hall was built with support from local tradespeople. Markets were held weekly on Tuesday afternoons ‘of which Notice is given by the Bell in a beautiful Cupulo painted and gilt’ as described in 1715 by Ralph Thoresby. Without the building of the hall, the growth of the economy of Leeds might well have been undermined and it would not have become the great city it is today.

The hall was superseded by three larger and more magnificent halls over the next two centuries. The larger Second White Cloth Hall in Meadow Lane (1756) was used as the town’s Assembly Rooms, where lavish balls, concerts and gambling took place; and in 1777 the Third White Cloth Hall was built (behind the Corn Exchange). This building took on a variety of uses over the years, often involving subdivision. The Baptists used part of it as a chapel and then the Revivalists. By 1811 its two wings fronting Kirkgate were occupied as houses with shops, the spacious rooms at the back being occupied by a Sunday School and the Lancasterian School. After years of neglect, the building was bought by Rushbond – here’s to the next 300 years!
