John Barran was a pioneer in the manufacture of ready-to-wear clothing, specialising in boy’s garments. He moved to Leeds in 1842 and soon opened a tailoring shop at 30 Bridge End South. By 1851 he had moved to Briggate and in 1856 he had a factory which housed up to 30 sewing machines. After seeing a band-saw being used to cut wood veneers in 1858 he introduced its use for cutting cloth, a major innovation in the industry. By the 1870s he had 2,000 machines operating in the factory and in 1904 he employed 3,000 people in Leeds.

St Paul’s House in Park Square, Leeds was built as a warehouse for Barran and was completed in 1877-1878. The ware was designed by architect Thomas Ambler and is in Moorish style. As business grew the company expanded and an additional factory was built on Hanover Street in 1888. John’s son Charles took over as chairman of the company in 1903, and another son Rowland became chairman in 1918, hence the introduction of the last company name ‘John Barran & Sons Ltd’.
