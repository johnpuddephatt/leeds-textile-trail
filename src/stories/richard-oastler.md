Richard Oastler, born 1789, was a Methodist preacher who lobbied for regulation to prevent cruelty to children working in the textile mills. In the 1830s he saw that children worked from 6am to 7pm with just one 40-minute break, and some were even beaten for arriving late or falling asleep.

On 16th October 1830 Oastler’s letter ‘Yorkshire Slavery’ was published in the Whig paper, the ‘Leeds Mercury’. Further letters and campaigning followed and he put forward the idea of  a ten hour day, while workers organised themselves into ‘Short Time Committees’ with Oastler as their leader. He became a powerful speaker and was supported by workers and the doctors who witnessed the ill health of factory employees. The movement had representation in Parliament, where Bills were introduced, and the second reading of a Bill in 1832 was marked by a march of 12,000 men from the West Riding to York. It was unsuccessful.

The first Bill limiting factory hours for women and children to 12 hours was passed by Peel’s Tory Government in 1844 and the Ten Hour Day Act was finally passed in 1847. Richard Oastler died in 1861. In 1869 a bronze statue to his memory was erected in Bradford and 100,000 people attended the ceremony.
