Since 1967, once a year as the heat of the summer sun shines down, the streets of Leeds have reverberated to the sound-systems and drums of the West Indian Carnival. But what really catches the eye are the incredible costumes bringing an exhilarating energy to the parade.

Legendary costume makers have included Hebrew Rawlins, Ken Wenham and Hughbon Condor and to wear one of their creations is an honour. Themes are chosen annually, with the costume for the various troupes, King and Queen and Prince and Princess taking hours to create. A true community effort, with mums, dad, sisters, brothers’ friends and relatives all working to finish off the meticulous coordinated costumes.

As one of Carnival founders, Arthur France MBE said; ‘Carnival also reminds us of our roots, the struggle our ancestors had to bear, the oppression of our leaders, and great role models, but not in vain, for while we continue to celebrate carnival their achievements will remain with us forever’.
