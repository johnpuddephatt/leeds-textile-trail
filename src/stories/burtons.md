Burton’s mission was to make good quality, affordable suits for everyday men. Arriving in the UK from Lithuania aged only 15, Meshe Osinksy - as he was then known - was a pioneer of manufacturing and high street retailing.

He changed his name to Montague Burton having found inspiration after spending an afternoon at Burton-on-Trent railway station. Just two years later he opened ‘The Cross-Tailoring Company’ in Chesterfield, and by 1910 more stores had followed in and around Sheffield and Leeds. Burton’s largest factory, employing over 10,000 people at one time, was based in Burmantofts, Leeds.

The start of World War I halted normal production and Burton shifted to uniforms, supplying nearly a quarter of all armed forces with their military wear. War efforts did not stop there; Burton dressed the army again in World War II and developed the demob suit, a suit which was given to all servicemen returning from war.

Montague Burton died in 1952, by which time the Burton empire reached a total of 616 stores worldwide with 14 factories. By 1997 Burton joined the Arcadia Group until it eventually was purchased by Philip Green in 2002, who became the first sole owner of Burton since Montague Burton himself. In early 2021 Burton was sold to Boohoo.com.
