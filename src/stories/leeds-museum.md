From garments charting local manufacturing and retail heritage to those charting local lives, the dress and textiles collection at Leeds Museum and Galleries has a staggering 20,000 single objects, or thereabouts.

Pieced together from donations and acquisitions, the collection ranges in date from the seventeenth century to the present day and includes everyday clothing and more expensive fashionable dress.

Firmly associated with the Leeds textile industry is the collection of nineteenth and twentieth century tailoring, with examples of bespoke and ready-to-wear tailoring from Burtons, John Barron and Hepworth’s and  lesser known names, including Legg & Millard. The collection also has a range of modern and contemporary designers from the twentieth century including Ozzie Clarke, Bill Gibbs, Mary Quant and Vivienne Westwood.
