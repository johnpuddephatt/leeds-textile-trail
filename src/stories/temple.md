Temple Works in Holbeck brought a taste of Egypt to Leeds when it was built in 1836. This Grade 1 listed former flax mill was once considered the largest room in the world, with over 2,600 employees working the various large scale machinery. To maintain the necessary humidity in the building, the roof was once covered with grass and was used for grazing sheep!

The Mill’s workforce was part of 1842’s Chartist inspired Plug Riots and numerous other strikes took place there to better working conditions, including a strike in 1871 which resulted in a 10% pay rise after the Leeds Mercury contrasted the poverty of the workforce with the lavish lifestyle of the Marshall’s.

The Marshall family sold the building at auction in 1886. In recent years, Temple Works has suffered extensive damage and deterioration. In 2017 it was bought by CEG, and plans for its future are in development.
