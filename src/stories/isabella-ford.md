In October 1888, 200 female weavers at Wilson and Sons went on strike in protest against changes in piece work rates and the system of fines employed by the company. A local woman, Isabella Ford, arranged for leaders of the General Union of Textile Workers to support the strikers and provided £50 a week towards their strike fund. She would continue to use her considerable personal wealth to support trade union and political activity for the rest of her life.

The strike prompted Isabella to reignite the organisation of tailoresses in the city and the Tailoresses Union flourished with her support.  In 1896 she was elected as a delegate to the Trade Union National Congress and was one of the few who dared to raise the issue of  sexual harassment at work.

In 1904 the Independent Labour Party, of which she was a member, published her influential pamphlet, Women and Socialism.  She argued that women should have the vote not only because of the political power it would give them but also because it would change the relationship between men and women.  She spent the final years of her life campaigning for peace, disarmament and international cooperation.  She sought the creation of a new world where women and men would realise their full potential as human beings and live in harmony with each other and their environment.
